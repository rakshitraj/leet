## Minimum Cost to Move Chips to The Same Position

We have `n` chips, where the position of the `ith` chip is `position[i]`.

We need to move all the chips to **the same position**. In one step, we can change the position of the `ith` chip from `position[i]` to:

- `position[i] + 2` or `position[i] - 2` with `cost = 0`.
- `position[i] + 1` or `position[i] - 1` with `cost = 1`.

Return *the minimum cost* needed to move all the chips to the same position.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: position = [1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: First step: Move the chip at position 3 to position 1 with cost = 0.
Second step: Move the chip at position 2 to position 1 with cost = 1.
Total cost is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/15/chip_e2.jpg)

```
Input: position = [2,2,2,3,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can move the two chips at poistion 3 to position 2. Each move has cost = 1. The total cost = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: position = [1,1000000000]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= position.length <= 100`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`



Hint #1 

The first move keeps the parity of the element as it is.

Hint #2 

The second move changes the parity of the element.

  Hide Hint #3 

Since the first move is free, if all the numbers have the same parity, the answer would be zero.

  Hide Hint #4 

Find the minimum cost to make all the numbers have the same parity.
